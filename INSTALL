build instructions:
  - be sure to have OpenGL and Qt installed on your system
  - cd ~KubixRoot
  - cmake .
  - make

run kubix via:
  - cd ~KubixRoot
  - ./Kubix
  attention: kubix currently needs the folder './res' in `pwd`
             in order to load the textures (for dice, etc).

clean directory:
  - cd ~KubixRoot
  - make clean
  - make distclean (to delete the temporary cmake files)
